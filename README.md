## Description
     This Readme generator was created to support coders to create professional looking documents to show the rest of the Userâ€™s why the repository was created and how does it work. The technology used was JavaScript and Node.js, the User needs to answer some questions that are prompted in the Terminal, these questions get saved and then are displayed in the corresponding part of the Readme. In case the User is using some kind of License, this can be selected, and the license badge will appear in the Readme, but if the User is not using a License, this section will be deleted. The code can be adapted to support more Licenses, right now only support 4 types, but one upgrade can be adding more options and more sections. To aid the User, the document generated will have a table of contents, this was created in order for the User to easily navigate the document and focus their attention to the relevant parts that they find in the Readme.
